As an AOI programmer at Sanmina, I was responsible for inspecting and testing printed circuit boards using automated optical inspection equipment. I have over seven years of experience in this role, and I have developed strong skills in typing, word processing, and spreadsheets. Previously, I worked as a Solderer at Sanmina for two years, where I performed soldering and rework of various components on PCBs. I also have five years of experience as an Edgebuild Assembler at PPG Industries, where I assembled and installed electrical and mechanical systems on aircraft windows. I have an AS degree in Computer Systems Networking and Telecommunications from John C Calhoun State Community College, and a certificate in Electrical/Electronics Maintenance and Repair Technology from Marshall Technical School. I also served as an Aircraft Electrical Systems Technician in the United States Marine Corps for four years. My mission is to ensure the quality and reliability of PCBs for various industries and applications. I am passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills. I value teamwork, integrity, and excellence in my work. I am looking for an opportunity to join a dynamic and innovative company that can offer me new challenges and growth.
